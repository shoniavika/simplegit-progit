When do I need to use synchronization constructs to prevent race conditions between donations?
What processes should happen when I call thread_set_priority?
What processes should happen when I call thread_get_priority?


GROUP PROJ
	priority donation: 
		t1 = 10 (priority)
		t2 = 63
		t1 grabs lock => t2 waits for t1 to release (in waiters) => t2 donate, t1_effective priority = 63
		t1 releases lock, go back to priority, yield = 10 => t2 no longer waiter, grabs lock =>
